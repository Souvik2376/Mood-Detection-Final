# Mood Detection Analyzer

This project demonstrates how Streamlit and NLP may be used to provide an engaging and dynamic user experience. LSTM, GRU, and Bidirectional are well-known natural language processing (NLP) models that are used in conjunction with TensorFlow, a crucial deep learning framework, to identify appropriate sentiment and to update deep learning models.


A unique NLP model on the website is in charge of managing several machine learning activities. The Streamlit-built frontend efficiently communicates with the NLP model to provide real-time predictions, visualisations, and other features that take use of machine learning capabilities and prediction confidence performance.

## Features

- Engaging user interface crafted using Streamlit.
- Seamless integration of a custom NLP models like LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional for machine learning tasks.
- Real-time predictions or visualizations powered by the LSTM model.
- Streamlit components ensuring scalability and maintainability.
- Streamlined deployment and hosting options for Streamlit deploy.
